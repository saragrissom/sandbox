<h1>About the DSG</h1>
<p>At the Digital Scholarship Group, we work every day to expand our understanding of digital scholarship. We help build it through the tools we provide to help Northeastern’s researchers publish and preserve their research. We look for ways to strengthen Northeastern’s expertise in research methods that engage and question the effects of the digital medium on culture and communication. We teach researchers at all levels new techniques of representation, analysis, and dissemination that are transforming scholarly research. Working as an applied research team within the library, we seek out new tools and methods, test them on real-world projects, and make them available to the Northeastern community. Through collaborative partnerships with projects at Northeastern and at peer institutions around the globe, we build bridges of shared knowledge.</p>

<h1>DSG, DSC, and NULab</1>
<h2>Digital Scholarship Commons (DSC)</h2>
<p>Opened in Spring 2014, the Digital Scholarship Commons provides a space at Snell Library for faculty and doctoral students to access a range of services for digital scholarship. The DSC is also a space for collaboration, where faculty can host workshops, meet with students, and connect with scholars in other disciplines. Features of the space include a computer lab, interactive workspaces with multiple laptop connectors, and spaces for small-group meetings.</p>
<br />
<h2>NULab for Texts, Maps, and Networks</h2>
<p>The NULab for Texts, Maps, and Networks is Northeastern’s center for Digital Humanities and Computational Social Science. NULab supports faculty research projects; trains graduate students in DH and CSS skills; sponsors talks and symposia; and provides fora for discussions of technology, teaching, and research at Northeastern. It is supported by the College of Social Sciences and Humanities and the College of Computer and Information Sciences. Many of the projects associated with NULab are also supported by the DSG. You can visit the NULab website <a href=“http://www.northeastern.edu/nulab/“>here</a>.</p>

<h1>The Future of the DSG</h1>
<p>The DSG opened its doors in January 2014. Our core staff offer expertise in digital publishing, open access and copyright, metadata and digital repositories, text encoding and XML, digital project management, data curation, digital humanities, and grant-writing. During the coming year we will be hiring three additional staff members to add expertise in GIS, web applications development, Omeka, and XML publishing tools. As we develop the DSG, our first priorities are to establish easy-to-use systems that enable researchers to develop and publish their own forms of digital scholarship, through tools like Omeka, Open Journal Systems, and other systems that can work in tandem with the Digital Repository Service. To support those interested in learning more, we are building a curriculum of workshops and seminars in a wide range of topics including XML, GIS, digital repositories, grant-writing, open access, text encoding, schema design, project management, and many others. We also welcome proposals from projects requiring more substantial development effort, especially those that would provide an opportunity to prototype new systems and methods that can benefit others.</p>
