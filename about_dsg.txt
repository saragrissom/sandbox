<h1>About the DSG</h1>
<br />
<p>At the Digital Scholarship Group, we work every day to expand our understanding of digital scholarship. We help build it through the tools we provide to help Northeastern’s researchers publish and preserve their research. We look for ways to strengthen Northeastern’s expertise in research methods that engage and question the effects of the digital medium on culture and communication. We teach researchers at all levels new techniques of representation, analysis, and dissemination that are transforming scholarly research. Working as an applied research team within the library, we seek out new tools and methods, test them on real-world projects, and make them available to the Northeastern community. Through collaborative partnerships with projects at Northeastern and at peer institutions around the globe, we build bridges of shared knowledge.</p>
